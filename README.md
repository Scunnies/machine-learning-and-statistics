## Project Folder
### Exploring Classifications Algorithms with the Iris Flower Dataset
The project is to create a notebook exploring classification algorithms applied on the iris flower data set associated with Ronald
A Fisher.

#### Assignment Brief:

 Explain what supervised learning is and what classification algorithms are.
Describe at least one common classification algorithm and implement it using the scikit-learn Python library.
Use appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams throughout to explain the relevant concepts.Python 3 was used to develop this project and is needed to run the code in the notebook. 

The Jupyter Notebook can be viewed directly in this GitHub repository in a browser without Python 3 being installed. 
If the repository is downloaded it can be run locally by navigating to the folder and entering the command jupyter lab or jupyter notebook on the command line. This will open Jupyter in the browser. 

Python 3 can be downloaded from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or using the Anaconda Python distribution at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.

The main python libraries used are loaded at the start of the code. The code should be run from top to bottom. 

## Tasks Folder
Each of the five topics covered in lectures has a task associated with it.  The solutions/answers to each of these five tasks is contained in a Jupyter notebook called `tasks.ipynb` along with file(s) relevant to completion of the tasks.  

### How to clone this repository

On GitHub at https://github.com/Scunnies/machine-learning-and-statistics click the green `Code` button, copy the URL for the repository. Open Git Bash, change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory, type `git clone`, and then paste the URL. Press Enter to create your local clone.

### References 

Harvard referencing style is used in the notebooks and/or in-text citations are hyperlinked to the relevant web resource (where available) and a reference list is appended in the relevant section of the notebook.
